Expectations:
    I hope to learn more about algorithms, understand middle-level development and be able to create projects with c++ technology

Annotations:
    namespace:
        Provides a solution for preventing name conflicts in large projects. Each entity needs a unique name.
        A namespace allows for identically named entities as long as the namespace are different.


Typedef : 
    reserved keyword used to create an additional name for another data type.
    New identifier for an existing type 
    Helps with readability and reduces typos
    Can be replaced with 'using' (work better with templates)

Input and Output:
    Use cin to get user's input (only one word)
    if it has more than one word, use std::getline()
    A example for using the getline function correctly:
        std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, {variable});
    For output, use std::cout like: 
        std::cout <<"Hello"<<"/n"

Ternary operator: condition ? expression_for_truth : expression_for_false;

Useful string methods: 
    string.length() - length of a string;
    string.empty() - return if the string is empty;
    string.clear() - clear an string;
    string.append(element) - add a element at the end of the string;
    string.at(index) - return the element in the index position on the string;
    string.insert(index, element) - put a new element in the index position
        without taking off the anterior element;
    string.find(element) - return the index of the first element founded in the 
        search;
    string.erase(startIndex, endIndex) - removes all elements between startIndex 
        and endIndex 

break: break out of a loop;
continue: skip current iteration;
random number generation: use{
    srand(time(NULL));
    
    rand() % x + 1;
} -> generates a number between 1 and x;
